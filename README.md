# rootEditor
A generic text/code editor, that supports languages like java, python, html, css, and javascript.
Really had fun with this project. It pushed me to my limits, and I learned a lot. Code is a bit messy, I will refactor in upcoming updates.
If you like the project and would like to collab for future ones. Reach out!!!
To try it out. Check out the runEditor repository.
